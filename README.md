# ü§ñ TerminatorTasks

TerminatorTasks is a robust .NET console application designed to monitor and terminate processes based on user-defined criteria.

## üöÄ Features

- **Process Monitoring**: Keep an eye on running processes on your system.
- **Process Termination**: Terminate processes matching specified conditions such as process name, lifetime, and refresh frequency.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: Effortlessly interact with the application using intuitive console prompts.
- **Graceful Exit**: Press the 'Q' key in the console to exit the application and stop process monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To start using TerminatorTasks:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TerminatorTasks.git
    ```

2. **Build the Project**: Open the solution file (`TerminatorTasks.sln`) in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE. Build the project to compile the source code.

3. **Run the Application**: Start the application by running the `TaskMain` class. This will launch the console interface where you can interact with the program.

4. **Follow Console Prompts**: Follow the prompts in the console to specify task parameters such as process name, lifetime, and refresh frequency.

5. **Monitor and Terminate Processes**: The application will continuously monitor the specified process. If the process is found, it will be terminated after the specified lifetime.

6. **Exit the Application**: Press the 'Q' key in the console to exit the application and stop process monitoring.
